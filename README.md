# Hospital Management System

The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive solution developed using advanced Java technologies including Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). This system aims to streamline operations within medical facilities, providing efficient management of resources and enhancing patient care. Below are the key features and functionalities of the system:

User Authentication:
The system offers secure user authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive information and perform operations within the system. This includes login/logout functionality with encrypted password storage for enhanced security.

Doctor and Staff Management:
Hospital administrators can efficiently manage doctors and staff members through the system. They can add new staff, assign roles, update information, and remove staff as needed. Doctors can view their schedules, manage patient appointments, and update their availability.

Patient Management:
The system provides a centralized platform for managing patient records and information. Front-desk staff can register new patients, schedule appointments, and update patient details. Doctors can access patient records, view medical history, prescribe medications, and record treatment notes.

Appointment Scheduling:
Patients can easily schedule appointments with doctors through the system, either online or by contacting the hospital. Staff can manage appointment slots, check doctor availability, and reschedule appointments if necessary. Automated reminders can be sent to patients to reduce no-shows.

By leveraging Servlets, JSP, and JDBC technologies, the Hospital Management System provides a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for medical facilities to optimize their operations, enhance patient care, and improve overall organizational efficiency.
